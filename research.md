### Sectoral Comovement during the Great Recession ###

### (Job market paper)  ###

We document three stylized facts about sectoral comovement in the U.S. during the Great Recession. First, the distribution of pairwise correlations of output growth rates between two sectors significantly shifts to the right during the recession but returns to the pre--recession level afterward; such shift is not observed in any previous recessions after the World War \rom{2}. Second, the pairwise correlations during the recession are positively correlated with the extensive degrees of interconnectedness between two sectors. Third, the ratio of trade credit relatively to sales contracted during the Great Recession. Moreover, two sectors that experienced such contraction have about 0.19 higher correlation on average than two that did not. To uncover the mechanism associated with these three facts, we  develop a multi--sector model incorporating an endogenous trade credit structure. The model shows that trade credit is adjusted according to both the intermediate supplier and client's financial conditions, and such adjustment has asymmetrical effects on sectoral outputs. If only the supplier (client) is financially constrained, trade credit is decreased (increased) so as to somewhat offset the effects of the bank lending shocks on the outputs of the supplier (client). However, if they are both financially constrained, trade credit is adjusted in the favor of the more tightened one, which imposes additional costs on the other. This adjustment amplifies a negative bank lending shock and causes sectoral outputs to fail together. Simulations imply that during a financial recession, the decline in trade credit amplifies shocks by 20% on real GDP.
